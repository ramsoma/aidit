MSK0027,OK,AN JUST BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURES THERE NOT YET FULLY MATURED AND STRONG AND SOMEBODY WHOS THAT YOUNG AND SO IT WILL CAUSE PAIN REDUCED RANGE OF MOTION AT THE ELBOW AND YOU WONT REALLY SEE MUCH SWELLING OR REDNESS AND WITH JUST THE PHYSICAL EXAM MANEUVER YOU CAN REDUCE IT AND THEN PUT THE HEAD OF THE RADIUS BACK INTO PLACE AND THINGS WILL BE USUALLY BACK TO BACK TO NORMAL BUT IF THERE IS A FRACTURE WHICH WILL LOOK FOR AN XRAY THEN THERE THE PAIN MIGHT BE LAST A LITTLE BIT LONGER BUT IMMOBILIZATION OF THE ARM IS NOT REQUIRED AND MOST KIDS WILL REGAIN FULL MOBILITY IN IN A SHORT TIME AFTER THE REDUCTION
