YEAH SO WHAT WE SHOULD DO FOR HER RIGHT NOW IS SHES SEVEN YEARS OLD UM WHAT IM THINKING RIGHT NOW WITH HER SYMPTOMS ESPECIALLY COMING ON AFTER UH EXERTION BEING WORSE IN THE WINTER SHE MAY HAVE ASTHMA
OK 
AND ALTHOUGH SHE DOESNT HAVE ANY FAMILY HISTORY OF IT IT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT FAMILY HISTORY AS WELL UM SO WE WOULD LIKE TO UH TRY AND DO UH WHATS CALLED A PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST THAT WILL HELP US KIND OF UNDERSTAND UH IF SHE HAS UM ASTHMA OR NOT AND THEN WE CAN TRY HER ON UM ITS CALLED A SHORT ACTING BETA AGONIST SO ITS A PUFFER
OK
AND UH USUALLY WHEN SHE GETS THESE TYPES OF SYMPTOMS SHE CAN USE THE PUFFER TO HELP HER UH AND IF IT UM HELPS HER THEN ITS MOST LIKELY THAT SHE DOES HAVE ASTHMA AND SHE WILL NEED UM THAT PUFFER AND THEN SHE MIGHT ALSO NEED ANOTHER PUFFER WHICH IS AN INHALED CORTICOSTEROID UM FOR THE FUTURE TO DECREASE UM THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS ASTHMA GETS WORSE IN THE FUTURE
OK OK YEAH THANK YOU
