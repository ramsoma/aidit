OK SO NEXT I JUST WANTED TO DO THE PHYSICAL EXAM PORTION AND ASK YOU TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE KNEE FIRST AND LET ME KNOW IF THE IF YOURE HAVING ANY SWELLING REDNESS OR WARMTH TO THE KNEE COMPARED TO THE OTHER SIDE
SURE
SORRY SO YOU ARE HAVING HAVING SWELLING WARMTH AND REDNESS TO THE RIGHT KNEE
YES
OK AND ARE YOU HAVING PAIN TO LIKE PALPATION IS THERE A SPECIFIC SPOT YOU CAN PRESS ON THAT CAUSES A SHARP PAIN
UM SO JUST BELOW THAT KNEECAP AREA THERE IS SOME SWELLING THERE AND WHEN I PRESS DOWN ON THAT SWOLLEN AREA IT CAUSES A BIT OF PAIN

OK SO THAT WAS A EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED TO ASK TODAY ON THE HISTORY AND AND PHYSICAL WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU MAYBE I FORGOT ABOUT YOU WANTED TO ADD 
NO I DONT THINK SO
OK SO RIGHT NOW ITS SOUNDING LIKE THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE A KNEE BURSITIS OR PREPATELLAR OR SORRY INFRA PATELLAR BURSITIS OR A PREPATELLAR BURSISTIS WHICH ARE THE KIND OF THE MORE COMMON TYPES ONE THING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE RULE OUT WOULD BE A SEPTIC BURSITIS ALTHOUGH YOURE NOT HAVING ANY FEVERS OR CHILLS SO THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT LESS LIKELY
MMMM
BUT IF YOUR SYMPTOMS ARE GETTING WORSE AND YOURE DEVELOPING A FEVER ITS BECOMING EVEN MORE PAINFUL THEN CERTAINLY WILL HAVE TO RULE OUT INFECTION AND AS WELL IF THINGS ARE NOT IMPROVING POTENTIALLY A STRUCTURAL DISEASE AND ANY SUCH AS A MENISCAL INJURY OR LIKE A LIGAMENTAL INJURY FROM ALL OF THE LIKE KNEELING AND AND REPETITIVE MOVEMENTS BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK ITS MOSTLY SOUNDING LIKE A KNEE BURSITIS
OK
OK AND TREATMENT FOR THAT WILL BE ACTIVITY MODIFICATION AS WELL AS USING THINGS LIKE AS UM NSAIDS AND ICING TO HELP WITH UM THE INFLAMMATION 
OK THAT SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU
