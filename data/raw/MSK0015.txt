NO OK SO I THINK THAT WAS EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED TO ASK ON HISTORY AND CHECK WAS THERE ANYTHING I MAYBE FORGOT ABOUT YOU THOUGHT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT TODAY
NO I THINK THATS ALL JUST JUST WAS WONDERING WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON
YEAH CERTAINLY SO A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT IT COULD BE ONE IS THAT IT CAN BE COMMON IN THIS AGE GROUP IS SOMETHING CALLED TRANSIENT SYNOVITIS WHERE WHICH CAN HAPPEN IN THE HIP WHERE THERES SOME INFLAMMATION AND IT CAUSES SOME PAIN FOLLOWING A VIRAL INFECTION AND IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE HAD A VIRAL INFECTION LAST WEEK WITH THE COUGH FEVER AND AND RUNNY NOSE AND HER SHE WAS FEELING A BIT WARM AND MAYBE FEVERISH TODAY AS WELL WHICH COULD BE A SIGN WITH THE LOWER KIND OF SLIGHTLY ELEVATED TEMPERATURE POINTING TOWARDS TRANSIENT SYNOVITIS WHICH IS A CONDITION THAT WILL BE SELF LIMITING AND CAN USE ANTI INFLAMMATORIES TO HELP WITH THE PAIN SUCH AS IBUPROFEN BUT ALSO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO RULE OUT WOULD BE IS SEPTIC ARTHRITIS BECAUSE IT COULD COULD LEAD TO DAMAGE OF THE JOINT BUT THIS WILL BE LOWER ON THE DIFFERENTIAL AND THEN FINALLY SOMETHING TO CONSIDER IS LEGGCALVEPERTHES DISEASE AND BUT THIS WOULD BE MORE OF PROGRESSIVE  ONSET BUT IF SHES NOT GETTING ANY BETTER AND OR IF SHE BECOMES MORE SICK LIKE DEVELOPS A REALLY HIGH FEVER OR A RED HOT SWOLLEN JOINT THEN WED BE THINKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF SEPTIC ARTHRITIS AND WE WANT TO REASSESS
OK SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH
