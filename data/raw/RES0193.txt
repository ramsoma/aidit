HE IS YES
OK SO WELL SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING CALLED A PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST SOMETIMES IT DEPENDS ON THE CHILD 
IF THEYRE ABLE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS AND SO THAT TEST REQUIRES A COMPLETELY BREATHING OUT AND FOLLOWING SOME INSTRUCTIONS DURING THE TEST SO SINCE HES SIX HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT WE WE CAN TRY THAT AND THEN AFTERWARDS WELL SEE IF HE REQUIRES ANYTHING LIKE AN ALLERGY TESTING OR WE WILL WE MIGHT NEED TO HELP MANAGE HIS SYMPTOMS WITH A PUFFER FOR EXAMPLE LIKE VENTILIN AND AN  INHALED CORTICO STEROID BUT THOSE ARE JUST SOME DISCUSSIONS WILL HAVE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AFTER WEVE DONE ALL THESE INVESTIGATIONS
