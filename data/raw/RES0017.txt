LIKE A IT COULD BE IMPORTANT UH BECAUSE UH WELL HOW LONG HOW LONG DID YOU LIVE THERE FOR 
I WOULD SAY ALMOST 20 YEARS 
OK SO UM YES THAT DEFINITELY WOULD BE IS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE HISTORY TODAY BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY LONG TERM EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS WHEN BREATHING IT IN CAN CAUSE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT YOUVE BEEN DESCRIBING ALONG WITH COUGH AND UH RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS SO ITLL BE SOMETHING THAT WELL BE SURE TO INVESTIGATE TODAY OK BUT I JUST HAD A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS FIRST DO YOU SMOKE CIGARETTES
I QUIT LONG TIME AGO MORE THAN LIKE 10 YEARS AGO BUT I USED TO SMOKE LIKE 5 TO 10 CIGARETTES FOR AROUND 20 YEARS
OK AND DO YOU SMOKE CANNABIS

OK AND DO YOU USE ANY OTHER RECREATIONAL DRUGS
NO
ALRIGHT AND ARE YOU CURRENTLY SEXUALLY ACTIVE 
NO
ALRIGHT AND HAVE YOU HAD A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION BEFORE 
NO 
OK SO THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT I WANTED TO GO OVER TO MAKE SURE I ASKED ON HISTORY WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT ELSE YOU WANTED TO TELL ME
NO I THINK THATS ALL
OK SO NEXT WELL DO YOUR PHYSICAL EXAM AND ORDER SOME INVESTIGATIONS BUT CURRENTLY THINKING THAT IT COULD BE RELATED TO ASBESTOS EXPOSURE AS WELL AS UM SOMETHING CALLED WELL IT COULD CAUSE PULMONARY FIBROSIS AND THEN ALSO THE JOINT PAINS THAT YOUVE BEEN EXPERIENCING MIGHT BE ANOTHER SYMPTOM THAT IS SUGGESTIVE OF A CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE AND IT DOESNT SOUND LIKE YOU HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY OF THOSE BUT WE WILL DO SOME LAB WORK AND INVESTIGATIONS FOR FOR THOSE INCLUDING A CHEST XRAY AND A CHEST CT
SOUNDS GOOD
