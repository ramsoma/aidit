NO OK ALRIGHT SO THOSE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAD FOR HER TODAY SO DEFINITELY SINCE THERE IS A RISK THAT SHE MIGHT BE HAVING ANOTHER EAR INFECTION WE WILL NEED TO DO LIKE A FULL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO HER EAR TO SEE IF I SEE ANY INFLAMMATION OR PERFORATION AND THEN BASED ON THAT WELL DISCUSS SOME MANAGEMENT SHE MAY REQUIRE SOME ANTIBIOTICS LIKE SHE HAS HAD BEFORE BUT THAT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT I SEE ON PHYSICAL EXAMINATION SHE HAS BEEN HAVING A FEVER SO SHE MIGHT AND ITS ONLY BEEN THREE DAYS RIGHT SO WE MAY EVEN DO SOME CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT AND GET HER TO TAKE SOME MAYBE PAIN MEDICATIONS AND THEN GO FROM THERE OR EAR DROPS 
OK
UH BUT YEAH SO WELL DO THE EXAMINATION AND THEN GO FROM THERE SHE SAID SHE HAS BESIDES THE FEVER AND THAT YOUR PAIN SHES NOT REALLY HAVING ANY OTHER SYMPTOMS SO I DONT THINK SHE NEEDS TO GET TESTED FOR COVID RIGHT NOW BUT THATS SOMETHING WE CAN CONSIDER AS WELL IF SHE DEVELOPS OTHER SYMPTOMS
