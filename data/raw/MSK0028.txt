YEAH ANY SWELLING OR REDNESS I DO SEE SOME JUST LIKE KIND OF LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS AREA SOME REDNESS KIND OF LOOKS LIKE SOME BRUISING IN IN THAT IN THAT REGION UHM I ALSO FEEL LIKE WHEN I LIKE TRY TO FLEX MY BICEPS KIND OF HAVE MOVED UPWARDS
OK IS THIS THE MASS OR LUMP THAT I YOU WERE MENTIONING EARLIER THAT YOU KINDA CAN NOTICE IN THE IN YOUR RIGHT ARM 
YEAH YEAH
OK IS THERE ANY TEMPERATURE CHANGE LIKE DOES IT FEEL WARM ON THAT SIDE
UHM I CANT REALLY TELL IF ITS WARM OR NOT
OK AND YOU SO YOU MENTIONED ARE YOU ABLE TO BEND YOUR ELBOW ALL THE WAY UP SO TO FLEX IT ALL THE WAY UP OR IS A RANGE OF MOTION LIMITED
ITS PRETTY LIMITED ITS PRETTY TOUGH TO FLEX ITS REALLY PAINFUL AND THAT I ALSO CANT LIKE I CANT TURN MY ARM I CANT SUPINATE

OUT LIKE AT THE SIDES OR IN FRONT OF ME
IN FRONT OF YOU 
YEAH THE SHOULDER SEEMS TO BE OK I AM ABLE TO LIFT UP BUT ITS JUST IF I TRY TO MOVE MY UPPER ARMS AT ALL IT HURTS A LOT
OK ALRIGHT SO YOULL GET SOME PAIN AT THE AT THE SHOULDER WITH THE MOVEMENT
THERE THERE IS DISCOMFORT IN THE AFFECTED SIDE BUT I CAN I CAN MOVE IT MUCH MORE THAN I CAN MOVE MY ELBOWS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
OK I SEE SO I THINK THAT WAS EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT AND AND I LOOK FOR ON ON THE PHYSICAL TODAY WAS THERE ANYTHING I MAY BE MISSED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
UHM NO I THINK UH I DONT HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
OK ALRIGHT SO BASED ON THE HISTORY AND WHAT YOURE TELLING ME FOR THE PHYSICAL AS WELL OF HAVING A HISTORY OF EXERCISING AND ALSO SHOULDER PAIN WITH OVERHEAD HEAD MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE RISK FACTORS FOR DEVELOPING A BICEPS TENDON TEAR OR BICEPS TENDON INJURY AND HAVING THE SWELLING AND BRUISING AS WELL AS REDUCED FUNCTION OF BICEPS OR ELBOW FLEXION THEY ALL SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A BICEPS TENDON TEAR OR INJURY THERE AND SO WILL WANT TO GET AN ULTRASOUND OR MRI TO LOOK AT WILL START WITH THE ULTRASOUND BUT THEN POSSIBLY GET AN MRI AS WELL TO LOOK AT THE EXTENT OF THE TISSUE DAMAGE BUT IF THERE IS JUST A LONG HEAD OF BICEPS TEAR IT WILL USUALLY BE TREATED CONSERVATIVELY AND SO WELL JUST NEED TO LOOK TO SEE WHAT THE EXTENT OF THE INJURY IS
OK
