YEAH
OK AND UM AND ANY KIND OF MOVEMENT HURTS RIGHT THERES NO PARTICULAR MOVEMENT THAT LIKE IF YOU WERE INSTEAD OF UM TRYING TO RAISE THAT SHOULDER BY ITSELF IF YOU WERE TO JUST MOVE IT WITH THE OTHER ARM DOES IT HURT
THE OTHER ARM THE OTHER ARM DOESNT HURT AT ALL
OR LIKE IF YOU WERE TO USE YOUR LEFT ARM TO TO PASSIVELY MOVE YOUR RIGHT ARM AND SHOULDER DOES THAT HURT OR IS IT WHEN YOU JUST TRY TO MOVE THE RIGHT ARM BY ITSELF
ITS OH IT STILL HURTS ANY ANY MOVING OF THE SHOULDER HURTS
 OK ALRIGHT SO YEAH SO BASED ON WHAT UM YOUVE TOLD ME SO FAR IN YOUR RECENT SHOULDER CUFF INJURY WHAT CAN SOMETIMES HAPPEN IS UH WITH THOSE INJURIES YOU MIGHT GET SOME UM INFLAMMATION AND WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IS SOMETHING CALLED UH ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS OR JUST COMMONLY KNOWS AS KNOWN AS A FROZEN SHOULDER AND THERES DIFFERENT STAGES SO THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO IN THE INITIAL STAGES LIKE FREEZING UM AND THEN THERES STIFFENING IN STAGE TWO AND THEN USUALLY AFTER 6 TO 12 MONTHS IT STARTS UH GETTING BETTER
OK
UM AND IT MIGHT ALSO AFFECT YOUR OTHER SHOULDER AS WELL SO WHAT WELL UM END UP DOING TODAY IS SEE IF UM WE CAN GET SOME UM IMAGING DONE SO WE CAN DO AN XRAY OF YOUR SHOULDER IM SURE YOUVE HAD X RAYS BEFORE SO WELL KIND OF COMPARE THEM TO YOUR SHOULDER X RAYS FROM BEFORE WE IF WE NEED TO WE CAN ALSO GET AN ULTRASOUND IF UM WE DONT UH WE CANT REALLY TELL FROM THE X RAYS AND THEN FROM THERE UM WE CAN GET SOME BLOOD WORK AS WELL UM JUST YOUR NORMAL BLOOD WORK AS WELL AS INFLAMMATION MARKERS AND THEN UM FROM THERE WELL NEED TO UH REALLY UM DISCUSS SOME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES SO YOUVE ALREADY TRIED SOME PHYSIOTHERAPY BUT NOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THATS UH ITS ITS CONSISTENT BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS A HIGH RECURRENCE RATE AND WE WILL DEFINITELY NEED TO FINISH THE FULL COURSE OF PHYSIOTHERAPY WHATEVER IT MAY BE UM BECAUSE IF PHYSIOTHERAPY DOESNT WORK WE MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER LIKE OTHER OPTIONS LIKE UM CORTICOSTEROID INJECTIONS RIGHT INTO YOUR SHOULDER
