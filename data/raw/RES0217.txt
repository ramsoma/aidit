SO I UNDERSTAND YOU REMOVED INSECTS FROM YOUR LEG EARLIER TODAY
YES I DID IT WAS UH IT WAS BEHIND MY LEFT UH KNEE KIND OF IN LIKE THE JOINT BEHIND WHERE IT BENDS UM IT WAS STUCK PRETTY GOOD ITS STILL KIND OF RED AND TENDER THERE I NOTICED IT BECAUSE THE BACK OF MY KNEE WAS STARTING TO JUST FEEL A BIT SORE UM NOT THE JOINT ITSELF BUT JUST KIND OF THE SKIN THE WHOLE AREA BACK THERE UM AND I FOUND THIS TICK I BROUGHT I BROUGHT IT IN WITH ME IF YOU WANTED TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT UM ITS IN LIKE THIS LITTLE PLASTIC CONTAINER UH AND I DONT REALLY KNOW WHEN I GOT IT I WAS HIKING ON FRIDAY UM AND THEN SATURDAY I WAS OUT IN MY GARDEN I HOPE THEYRE NOT AROUND MY HOUSE I HOPE THAT IT WAS FROM HIKING UM AND NOT GARDENING BUT UH I DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUTSIDE ON SATURDAY AS WELL
OK SO SOUNDS LIKE ITS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SINCE YOU WERE LAST OUTDOORS TO WHEN YOU FIRST NOTICED IT
YEAH
OK SO WHEN YOU PICKED IT OFF THE TICK OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE IT FOR ME IS IT QUITE SWOLLEN OR ENGORGED
ITS NOT TOO BAD UM I I HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A TICK IN THE PAST AND THIS IS A LONG TIME AGO AND UM MAYBE LIKE 10 YEARS AND I ACTUALLY HAD THAT KIND OF TARGET RASH THING THAT THEY TALK ABOUT AND UH AT THAT TIME I REMEMBER I HAD TO TAKE ANTIBIOTICS FOR A BIT UM THIS UM DIDNT LOOK LIKE THAT IT WAS MORE IT WAS JUST KIND OF SORE IN ONE SPOT I DONT THINK IT UM IT WAS AS BAD AS THAT TIME AND THE TICK THAT TIME SORRY IVE KIND OF GOTTEN OFF TRACK THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE SWOLLEN THIS ONE WAS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT AS MUCH
OK SO JUST IN TERMS OF THE TICKS SIZE IT DOESNT LOOK LIKE ITS BEEN FEEDING FOR TOO LONG SO WHEN TICKS UH ARE FEEDING THEY TEND TO ENGORGE THEY TEND TO SWELL UP SO THIS LOOKS MORE LIKE A TINY LITTLE BUG OR DOES IT KIND OF LOOK LIKE A LITTLE GRAPE ALMOST LIKE ITS BEEN SWOLLEN UP WITH BLOOD
NO THIS ONE THIS ONES PRETTY SMALL
THIS ONES PRETTY SMALL OK AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT WELL OBVIOUSLY YOUVE HAD A TICK BITE IN THE PAST THE BIG CONCERN FOR US IS A DISEASE CALLED LYME DISEASE WHICH IS SPREAD BY BACTERIA BUT IN FACT ONLY ONE TYPE OF TICK PREDOMINANTLY IS A TRANSMISSION TRANSMITORY AGENT FOR IT ITS CALLED A DEER TICK AND ITS COLORATION ITS GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A BROWN BUTT AND THERES SOME BLACK LEGS DOES IT LOOK LIKE THAT AT ALL
I DONT THINK SO UHM I UH I WAS LOOKING AT THE PICTURES ONLINE I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE THE OTHER KIND OF TICK UM BUT I HEARD THAT YEAH BUT I HEARD THAT LATELY NOW THEYVE BEEN CONSIDERING ALL TICKS IN THIS AREA AS POSSIBLY CARRIERS OF LYME UM BECAUSE I THINK ITS KIND OF BECOME MORE MORE OF A PROBLEM SM SO THAT WAS MAKING ME A BIT NERVOUS
OK ABSOLUTELY WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN SEND THIS TICK OFF TO THE LAB AND THEYLL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIES FOR IT BUT FOR TICK BITES IN GENERAL ONE OF THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS IS FOR HOW LONG ITS BEEN ON YOUR BODY FOR SO UNFORTUNATELY IF YOURE OUT ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY THATD MEAN THAT THIS TICK HAS BEEN ON YOU FOR LONGER THAN AT LEAST 72 HOURS SO I THINK ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WERE LIKELY GOING TO HAVE TO PUT YOU ON ANTIBIOTICS JUST AS KIND OF A PROPHYLACTIC AT THE VERY LEAST JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT UM YOURE NOT AT RISK OF DEVELOPING LYME DISEASE IM SURE YOUVE HEARD FROM THE NEWS THAT LYME DISEASE CAN PRESENT IN A VARIETY OF WAYS BUT ITS A DISEASE THAT WE TRY OUR BEST TO AVOID AND JUST IN TERMS OF YOUR SYMPTOMS SO YOU SAY YOUVE HAD A BITE IN THE PAST AND YOU YOUVE GOT THAT RASH BEFORE THAT KIND OF BULLSEYE RASH DO YOU HAVE THAT RASH NOW
NO I DONT UH AS FAR AS I KNOW I MEAN YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK TOO ITS BEHIND MY KNEE SO ITS NOT THE EASIEST PLACE TO SEE BUT ITS UH IT LOOKS A LITTLE RED ITS LIKE TENDER WHERE THE TICK WAS BUT I DONT SEE THAT LIKE LARGER CIRCLE RASH
OK THATS REASSURING NOW ANY ITD BE PRETTY UNLIKELY FOR YOU TO HAVE OTHER SYMPTOMS BUT JUST IN CASE DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER JOINT PAIN 
NO
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING ILL OR HAVE BEEN FEVERISH IN THE LAST LITTLE WHILE
NO NO IVE BEEN FINE
OK AND YOU REMOVED THAT TWIT TICK ONCE YOU FOUND IT YOU PRESENTED TO ME HAVE YOU CHECKED YOUR BODY FOR ANY OTHER POSSIBLE BITES
OH YEAH I LOOKED AROUND AND I LOOKED AT MY HUSBAND TOO CAUSE WE WE WERE JUST A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW GAVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A SCARE BUT NO THERES BEEN NOTHING ELSE
THATS GOOD AND DID YOU BRING A PET WITH YOU AT ALL WHEN YOU WERE HIKING AND GARDENING
UH NO I DIDNT NO
OK GOOD ANY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS YOU THINK MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
UH NO IT WAS JUST UH ME AND MY HUSBAND
OK AND WHAT GEOGRAPHIC AREA WERE YOU IN UM WHEN YOU WERE HIKING
WE WERE UH IN STRATHROY ALONG THE CREEK
OK I CAN DO IF I REMEMBER THERES A LYME DISEASE DISTRIBUTION MAP FOR ONTARIO AND WE CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW THAT LINES UP TO SEE IF WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED OR NOT LOOKS LIKE STRATHROY IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE CONSIDERED A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERNING POINT SO I THINK THAT WE WILL BE MOVING FORWARD WITH ANTIBIOTICS BUT OF COURSE WELL BE TALKING TO THE PHYSICIAN WHOLL BE HAVING A LOOK AT YOU AS WELL SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVENT BEEN HAVING TOO MUCH SYMPTOMS ASIDE FROM YOUVE NOTICED THIS TICK THE SKIN AROUND IT IS FAIRLY SORE AND YOUVE HAD THIS IN THE PAST BUT YOU WERE TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS IN THE PAST AND SINCE THEN YOU HAVENT HAD TOO MANY HEALTH PROBLEMS AFTER THAT
NO NO IVE BEEN PRETTY HEALTHY
OK AND JUST ABOUT YOUR HEALTH RIGHT NOW IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU SEE THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN OR DOCTOR FOR IN GENERAL AND REGARDING YOUR HEALTH
UH JUST FOR MY CHOLESTEROL
OK ARE YOU TAKING AND MEDICATIONS FOR THAT
UH YEAH I TAKE A UH STATIN CANT REMEMBER WHICH ONE 
OK GOT IT AND DO YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIES
UH NO
SO NO DRUG ALLERGIES
NO
OK NOW WEVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT OTHER EXPOSURES SO IT DOESNT SOUND LIKE ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY OR ANY PETS ARE AROUND SO ITS UNLIKELY THAT YOU HAVE TICKS COMING IN AND YOU SAID YOU MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THIS FROM GARDENING BUT UM YOURE HOPING THAT YOUR AREA DOESNT HAVE TICKS MAYBE JUST TAKE A LOOK TICKS LIKE TO LIVE IN LONG GRASS KIND OF ON THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN WOODS AND FIELDS TO SEE IF THERES ANY HOVERING AROUND THAT KIND OF MAKE A WAVING MOTION WITH THEIR LEGS AND THEYRE SOMETIMES EASY TO SPOT YOU MIGHT WANNA GET SOME INSECTICIDE OUT THERE BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS FAIRLY RECENT UNFORTUNATELY JUST FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME THIS TICK MIGHT BE ON YOU FOR ITS PROBABLY SAFER THAN NOT TO START YOU ON SOME MEDICATIONS BUT IM GOING TO GO TALK TO THE DOCTOR AFTER WE DO A QUICK PHYSICAL EXAM AND WE MIGHT ALSO SEND THE TICK OFF TO A LOCAL LABORATORY SO THEY CAN IDENTIFY THE SPECIES FOR IT DEFINITIVELY AS WELL AS MIGHT JUST SEND SOME BLOOD WORK JUST TO SEE IF THERES ANY TITRES OR ANY SEROLOGY THAT WOULD MAKE US A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCERNED FOR LYME DISEASE BUT ASIDE FROM THAT YOUVE BEEN FEELING WELL OTHERWISE
YEAH TOTALLY FINE IT WAS JUST A LITTLE TENDER THERE AND THATS THE ONLY REASON I LOOKED
