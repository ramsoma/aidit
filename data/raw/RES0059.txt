OK GOOD GOOD DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ANYTHING THAT YOU WANTED TO BRING UP THAT I DIDNT TOUCH ON TODAY
YEAH I WAS JUST REALLY WORRIED THAT THIS COULD BE COVII MEAN I HAVE A COUGH AND JUST HAVE BEEN FEELING REALLY HOT SO I WAS JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THAT
YEAH FOR SURE AND I THINK THATS A VALID CONCERN SO RIGHT NOW IM JUST GOING THROUGH YOU KNOW A LIST OF DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE AND COVIITS DEFINITELY TOP ON MY LIST AND SO WE WILL LIKELY GET A SWAB AND RUN THOSE TESTS AND TRY TO GET THAT BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS WE CAN IT COULD ALSO BE OTHER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS ESPECIALLY VIRAL INFECTIONS THIS TIME OF THE YEAR AND SO IF IT COMES BACK NEGATIVE FOR COVIITS PROBABLY YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE LIKE RESPIRATORY VIRUS OR EVEN THE FLU SO WELL GO FROM THERE AND IF IT TURNS OUT ITS NOT A VIRAL INFECTION WE WILL LIKELY SEE IF ITS SOME SORT OF BACTERIAL INFECTION IN WHICH WE CAN PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTICS FOR THOSE BUT IT DEFINITELY SOUNDS LIKE THERES AN INFECTIOUS PICTURE GOING ON HERE BECAUSE OF THE ACUTENESS OF THE PRESENTATION AND JUST YOUR SYMPTOMS SO WE WILL DO AFOLLOW UP IN A WEEK OR SO UNTIL THEN WE WILL RUN ALL THESE LABS DOES THAT SOUND GOOD
ALRIGHT YEAH THAT SOUNDS GOOD SO I GUESS I WILL KIND OF SELF ISOLATE UNTIL THE COVIRESULTS COME BACK 
OH YES PLEASE DO SO THATS THATS A GREAT POINT I DO SUGGEST ISOLATING FOR TWO WEEKS AT LEAST IF YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF SYMPTOMS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE PCR THAT WE DO TO TEST FOR COVIIS SUPPOSED TO BE RELIABLE AND ITS SUPPOSED TO BE SPECIFIC AND SENSITIVE THERE ARE SOMETIMES FALSE NEGATIVE TESTS YOU KNOW JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE IF YOURE EXPERIENCING ANY OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT OVERLAP WITH COVISYMPTOMS ISOLATE FOR TWO WEEKS BUT BY THE END OF THE WEEK WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE TEST RESULTS ARE AND THEN YOU WILL KNOW FOR SURE WHAT YOU HAVE
OK AWESOME THANK YOU
YEAH THANK YOU
