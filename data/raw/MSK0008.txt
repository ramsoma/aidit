MMMM
OK SO I THINK THAT WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED TO ASK AND AND KIND OF GO THROUGH ON THE PHYSICAL EXAM DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR ANYTHING THAT MAYBE I FORGOT TO MENTION TODAY
AH NO THAT WAS IT JUST WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT MY MY KNEE
YEAH SO RIGHT NOW ITS SOUNDING LIKE THIS COULD BE AN MCL OR MEDIAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT STRAIN OR INJURY AND SO THESE TYPES OF INJURIES ARE USUALLY TREATED CONSERVATIVELY LIKE WITH THINGS LIKE NSAIDS OR ANTIINFLAMMATORIES TO HELP THAT PAIN AND SWELLING IF THE PAIN DEPENDING ON HOW SEVERE IT IS IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO USE MAYBE CRUTCHES FOR A DAY OR TWO TO TRY TO HELP LET THE PAIN TO SUBSIDE AND ALLOW YOU TO BE ABLE TO DO SOME PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISES LIKE STRENGTHENING THE QUADRICEPS AND HAMSTRING MUSCLES 
OK
BUT TYPICALLY INJURIES THAT ARE LOWER GRADE WILL HEAL WITHIN TWO WEEKS AND SO IF ITS MORE MORE SEVERE IT COULD TAKE A BIT LONGER AND ALTHOUGH THAT ITS MOST LIKELY AN MCL INJURY THAT YOURE DESCRIBING IT COULD BE A MEDIAL MENISCAL INJURY AS WELL OR POSSIBLY EVEN A BURSITIS AT THE MEDIAL ASPECT OF THE KNEE BUT THE TREATMENT TO START WITH WOULD BE THE SAME AND MAYBE WE WILL GET ANY XRAY IF THINGS ARENT IMPROVING
OK THAT SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU
