OK HOW ABOUT MOVING THE REST OR SHOULDER
NO THATS FINE
OK SO THAT THAT WAS EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT AND AND LOOK FOR ON THE PHYSICAL TODAY DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THAT PERHAPS I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT
UHM NO THAT WAS KIND OF IT I JUST WAS WONDERING HOW WE CAN FIX HER ELBOW
I YEAH CERTAINLY SO IT WILL BE SO WHEN I GET AN ELBOW X RAY AND BUT TYPICALLY TO FIX THIS TYPE OF INJURY SO CURRENTLY IM THINKING THIS COULD BE A LIKE A RADIAL HEAD SUBLUXATION AND POSSIBLY A RADIAL HEAD FRACTURE BUT MOST LIKELY I RADIAL HEAD SUBLUXATION WHERE THERES A MECHANISM OF PULLING ON A CHILDS ARM AND ITS JUST THAT THE WHAT COULD HAPPEN IS THE PART OF THE RADIUS WHICH IS THAT A FOREARM BONE CAN PULL OUT OF THE LIGAMENT THATS HOLDING IT DOWN
OK
AN JUST BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURES THERE NOT YET FULLY MATURED AND STRONG AND SOMEBODY WHOS THAT YOUNG AND SO IT WILL CAUSE PAIN REDUCED RANGE OF MOTION AT THE ELBOW AND YOU WONT REALLY SEE MUCH SWELLING OR REDNESS AND WITH JUST THE PHYSICAL EXAM MANEUVER YOU CAN REDUCE IT AND THEN PUT THE HEAD OF THE RADIUS BACK INTO PLACE AND THINGS WILL BE USUALLY BACK TO BACK TO NORMAL BUT IF THERE IS A FRACTURE WHICH WILL LOOK FOR AN XRAY THEN THERE THE PAIN MIGHT BE LAST A LITTLE BIT LONGER BUT IMMOBILIZATION OF THE ARM IS NOT REQUIRED AND MOST KIDS WILL REGAIN FULL MOBILITY IN IN A SHORT TIME AFTER THE REDUCTION
OK THAT SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU
