OK HAVE YOU HAD ANY WEAKNESS DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE LESS STRENGTH IN YOUR ARM
UM I DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME LESS STRENGTH IN MY LEFT ARM BUT ITS IM NOT REALLY USING IT MUCH SO ITS HARD TO TELL
OK  AND HOW ABOUT A RANGE OF MOTION DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD LIFT YOUR LEFT ARM UP TO LIKE SCRATCH YOUR HEAD AND BACK
IT DOES HURT LIKE WHEN I TRY TO LIFT MY ARM UP

AND HAVE YOU HAD ANY URINARY PROBLEMS
NO
OK AND IN THE PAST HAVE YOU BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH ANY MEDICAL CONDITIONS
UH NO IVE BEEN A PRETTY HEALTHY ACTUALLY JUST JUST THAT OVERUSE INJURY LIKE TWO YEARS AGO
OK GREAT AND DO YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS 
NO
OK DO YOU TAKE ANY MEDICATIONS REGULARLY
JUST RECENTLY IVE BEEN TAKING A LOT MORE OF THE ADVIL BUT THATS ABOUT IT
OK I AND HAVE YOU HAD ANY HOSPITALIZATIONS OR PRIOR SURGERIES
NO NO PRIOR SURGERIES OR HOSPITALIZATIONS
OK AND COULD YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR LIVING SITUATION CURRENTLY LIKE WHO YOURE LIVING WITH AND WHEREABOUTS

NO OK HOW ABOUT SMOKING CIGARETTES OR CANNABIS
NO IVE NEVER SMOKED
DO YOU USE ANY RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR HAVE YOU IN THE PAST
NOPE
OK UM AND SO SO THE NEXT PART JUST FOR THE PHYSICAL EXAM SO DO YOU HAVE PAIN WITH SHOULDER AB DUCTION
UHM YES SO JUST TO YEAH I DO HAVE SOME PAIN ESPECIALLY FROM YEAH YEAH PAIN THROUGHOUT AB DUCTION
OK IS THERE ANY LIKE PAIN THATS LIKE PARTS OF THAT THAT RANGE OF MOTION THAT ARE MORE PAINFUL FOR YOU 
YEAH SO PROBABLY FROM 60 DEGREES TO 120 DEGREES IS MORE PAINFUL 
OK AND IF YOUR ARM IS OUTSTRETCHED AND YOUR THUMB POINTING DOWN SO YOUR ARM IS INTERNALLY ROTATED DOES THAT GIVE YOU PAIN
YEAH IF YEAH NOT NOT JUST LIKE THAT BUT IF YOU WERE TO LIKE PRESS DOWN ON IT IT THE INTERNAL ROTATION DOES CAUSE A LITTLE BIT OF PAIN
OK OK SO IT SOUNDS LIKE A POSITIVE JOBES TEST AND A POSITIVE NEERS TEST AS WELL AS A PAINFUL ARC FOR YOUR SHOULDER AND IS THERE PAIN TO PALPATION
UH JUST TO YEAH DEFINITELY JUST AT THE FRONT OF THE SHOULDER THERE IS SOME SOME PAIN OVER WITH PALPATION
OK THAT SENSATION IS NORMAL REFLEXES ARE NORMAL AND STRENGTH IS SLIGHTLY REDUCED AS WELL OK SO THAT WAS EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED TO ASK ON HISTORY AND CHECK ON THE PHYSICAL EXAM AS WELL WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WANTED TO MENTION TODAY THAT I MAYBE FORGOT
NO I THINK THATS IT
OK UM SO BASED ONI KNOW THAT THE SYMPTOMS TODAY ALONG WITH YOUR AGE AND PRIOR HISTORY OF AN OVERUSE INJURY OF THE LEFT SHOULDER IT CERTAINLY RAISES CONCERN OF HAVING A ROTATOR CUFF TEAR OR UM A ROTATOR CUFF IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME AND WHERE THERE IS INFLAMMATION THERE NOT NECESSARILY ACTUALLY A FULL TEAR OF THE MUSCLE THATS CAUSING THE PAIN SO UH THOSE WOULD BE THE TWO MOST LIKELY THINGS YEAH THEIR ROTATOR CUFF TEAR OR SUBACROMIAL IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME AND SO WE WERE GOING TO GET AN ULTRASOUND OF THE LEFT SHOULDER TO EVALUATE THE STRUCTURES AND POSSIBLY SOME OTHER IMAGING SUCH AS AN X RAY OR MRI TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE INJURY IN THE LEFT SHOULDER
OK SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU
